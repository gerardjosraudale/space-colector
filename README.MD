# Overview

As a software engineering student, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skill set by taking on projects that challenge my coding abilities and understanding of game development. This project, "Space Collector," is a 2D game designed to help me learn game development concepts, including sprite management, collision detection, and handling user input using the Python arcade library.

In "Space Collector," the player controls a spaceship to collect stars while avoiding asteroids. The goal is to collect as many stars as possible while avoiding losing points by hitting asteroids. The game is designed to be simple yet engaging, offering an opportunity to enhance my game development skills.

My primary purpose for writing this software is to gain practical experience with a game framework like arcade and improve my understanding of game loops, real-time rendering, and sound integration.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

Operating System: macOS
Editor: Visual Studio Code
Python Version: 3.9
Game Framework: arcade
Additional Libraries: random, os (if needed)

# Useful Websites

Here is a list of websites that were helpful during the development process:

Python Arcade Documentation
Stack Overflow
Pygame vs Arcade Comparison - Helpful in choosing the right framework for the project.
Free Sound Effects - For downloading sound effects for the game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add more challenging levels with increasing difficulty.
* Implement a power-up system for temporary boosts (e.g., shields or speed).
* Improve collision detection and add visual effects when objects collide.
* Optimize the game's performance to run smoother on different platforms.
